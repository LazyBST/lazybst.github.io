# Why use OpenTelemetry?

Say bye to proprietary vendor agents, say hello to open source

![opentelemetry](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/4c4cfdac9edf0e5840f9e6b87b6308e7570152a0/4b448/img/website/vendorlockin-otel.svg)

#### No vendor lock-in with OpenTelemetry

![opentelemetry](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/5912bc30efa36d738e01cf654a38a917a7092a27/d7521/img/website/standardise-otel.svg)

#### Standardize Observability with one open source standard

![opentelemetry](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/1b248fcd09239dce31e93d464752acf0342580d6/050eb/img/website/high-quality-otel.svg)

#### High Quality Telemetry with intelligent correlation

# Why get locked-in with SaaS vendors like DataDog when you can use Open source?

Cubeapm is based natively on OpenTelemetry, a vendor neutral open source standard for instrumentation. No fear of instrumenting with vendor SDK and getting locked in.

Your data storage cost is only dependent on your application load, rather than factors like number of nodes, which is an architectural preference.

No compliance needed to use Cubeapm. No need to go through multiple rounds with legal/security teams just for trying it out.

# Why Cubeapm?

Native support for OpenTelemetry, emerging industry standard for instrumentation

Monitor your usage & set your own retention period and sampling rate based on your needs

Scalable & modular architecture to handle enterprise scale. No scaling pains. Ever.

Built on latest stack - Golang & React-Typescript loved by developers
